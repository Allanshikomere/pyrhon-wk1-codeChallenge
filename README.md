# pyrhon-wk1-codeChallenge
Welcome to our coding challenges! Below are the descriptions of the challenges along with examples.

# Challenge 1: Minimum Moves to Equalize Bricks
You are given an array A representing the number of bricks in each box. The goal is to determine the minimum number of moves needed to end up with exactly 10 bricks in every box.

Function Signature:

python
Copy code
def solution(A):
    pass
In this challenge, we need to implement the solution function that takes an array A and returns the minimum number of moves. A move involves taking one brick from a box and moving it to a neighboring box (left or right).

# Challenge 2: Maximum Sum of Two Numbers with Equal Digit Sums
Given an array A of integers, find the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum.

Function Signature:

python
Copy code
def solution(A):
    pass
For this challenge, we are tasked with implementing the solution function to find the maximum sum of two numbers from the array A such that the sum of their digits is equal.

# Challenge 3: Generate Strings with Equal Occurrences of Letters
Given an integer N, return a string of length N containing as many different lowercase letters ('a'-'z') as possible, in which each letter occurs an equal number of times.

Function Signature:

python
Copy code
def solution(N):
    pass
In this challenge, we need to implement the solution function to generate a string of length N with as many different lowercase letters as possible. Each letter should occur an equal number of times in the string.
